**THE FAST AND FURIOUS (copyright)**

This project, Tesla Cybertruck Optimization, was completed by The Fast and Furious team as part of the BSAN 740 course. The focus of our project is to explore the strategic decisions behind allocating Tesla’s Cybertruck to dealerships across various locations. We utilize optimization techniques to balance customer demand with Tesla’s brand exclusivity.

  The primary objectives of this project include:
    **Analyzing demand forecasts to ensure optimal allocation.**
    **Minimizing transportation and production costs.**
    **Managing holding cost constraints to avoid excess inventory.**
    **Maintaining a balance between customer demand and brand exclusivity.**
This project leverages optimization concepts covered in the BSAN 740 course to explore these factors in depth, demonstrating how strategic resource allocation can enhance the brand's operational efficiency.
